## What is Git?

Git is the most popular [disturbed version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control) used to track changes for files and folders in a given project. Git allows you to easily manage your code and collaborate with other developers on the same project.

Git provides you with a detailed history of all of your changes for a given project. This makes it easy to review past updates, track progress over time, or even revert to earlier versions if needed.

Git also supports collaboration across the globe. Developers can work on their own local copies of a project and then push their changes to a shared repository—enabling teamwork without overwriting each other's work. You'll learn more about what a repository is and how to push changes in an upcoming section.

## Working with Git and the Command Line

Most of the examples in these guides, as well as the freeCodeCamp Discord workshops, will reference Git commands in the command line. The command line is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands, which are executed by a command-line interpreter (also known as a shell).

You'll typically access the command line through a program called a terminal. Here is an example of my customized terminal:

![Example terminal snapshot](../../../assets/terminal-snapshot.png)

If you are using a macOS, you can access the [Terminal application](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/get-started-pht23b129fed/2.14/mac/15.0) that already comes installed on your device. Another popular option would be [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)

If you are using Windows, you can use Command Prompt or [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.5).

<Aside title="What about GUIs?">
    A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a way to interact with your computer in a visual way instead of using text commands. For example, if you wanted to open a folder, then you can double click on it to see its contents.

    There are several <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis" target="__blank">GUI tools</a> like GitHub Desktop, and GitKraken that you can use in place of the command line.

    While there is nothing wrong with using these tools, it is good to know the basics of working with the command line.

</Aside>

## Installing Git on your Computer

Before you can begin working with Git, you need to first make sure it is installed on your computer.

Here is a [guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on how to install Git for Linux, Mac and Windows.

To check if Git was properly installed, you can run the following command in the command line:

<Code language="bash" code="git --version" />

If you get back a version number like this, then that means it was installed properly.

<Code language="bash" code="git version 2.50.0" />

If you don't get back a version number, that means something probably went wrong with the installation process and you will need to try installing Git again.

## Setting up Git

Once Git is installed on your computer, there are a few configurations that you will need to setup.

Here is a [guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) on how to setup those global configurations.

## Git Repositories

A repository(or repo for short) is a storage location (like a folder or project) where Git tracks all the changes made to files over time.

### Initializing a Git Repository

Let's walk through how to initialize a new empty Git repository.

<Steps>

1.  Open up your terminal.

2.  Use the following `cd`(change directory) command to navigate to a directory(also known as a folder) of your choice to create a new project. Here is an example of navigating to the `Desktop` directory on Mac.

    ```bash
    cd Desktop
    ```

3.  Use the `mkdir`(make directory) command to create an empty folder.

    ```bash
    mkdir example-git-project
    ```

4.  Then `cd` to that new folder.

    ```bash
    cd example-git-project
    ```

5.  To initialize an empty Git repository, you will need to run the `git init` command. Otherwise, you will not be able to use Git to start tracking changes for this project.
    You should see the following output:

    ```bash
    git init

    # Result
    Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/jessicawilkins/Desktop/example-git-project/.git/
    ```

    To view the `.git` folder, you can run the `ls -a` command which shows all files and folders including hidden ones like the `.git` directory.
    You should see this output:

    ```bash
    ls -a

    # Result
    .         ..        .git      README.md
    ```

    The `.` refers to the current directory while the `..` refers to the parent directory. So in the example, the parent directory would be the `Desktop` directory.

</Steps>

### What is Inside of the .git Directory?

If you want to take a peek inside of the `.git` directory, you can run the following commands:

```bash
cd .git
ls
```

You should see this output:

```bash
HEAD        config      description hooks       info        objects     refs
```

Here is a basic breakdown of all of those files and folders:

| Term        | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HEAD        | The main label pointing to the current version of the project. Think of it as a bookmark showing where you are right now in your work. |
| config      | Contains settings or options that control how the project behaves. Like a list of rules or preferences.                                |
| description | A short summary or name for the project. It helps you understand what the project is about.                                            |
| hooks       | Small scripts that run automatically before or after certain actions (like saving or sending a file). Useful for automation.           |
| info        | Contains general information about the project's current state, such as version details.                                               |
|             |
| objects     | Stores the actual content (like files and versions). This is where most of the project's data lives.                                   |
|             |
| refs        | Short for "references." These are pointers to specific versions or branches in your project history.                                   |

If you are curious and want to dive deeper into the internals and plumbing of Git, then you can read through this [resource](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain#ch10-git-internals).

<Aside type="caution" title="Should you delete the .git directory?">
    The `.git` directory holds very important information regarding your project.
    So if you remove it you will lose that history and your project will no longer
    be under version control. 
  
    The likelihood of you accidentally deleting the `.git` directory in a
    daily scenario is pretty low. Especially since the `.git` directory is
    hidden by default.

    If you do decide to remove it, just make sure you understand the effects.

</Aside>

## Staging Your files

Now that an empty Git repository has been initialized, it is time to add a file and start tracking that file.

### Creating a new file

Make sure you are in the correct project directory that you created earlier. If you are not sure, then you can run the `pwd`(Print Working Directory) command.

```bash
pwd
```

If the result is still showing the `.git` directory, then you will need to run the `cd ../` command to go up a folder back to the root project directory.

```bash
cd ../
```

In the command line, you can add a file using the `touch` command followed by the file name like this:

```bash
touch README.md
```

A `README.md` file is is a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file that contains important information about your project. This will include project features, how to set it up and run it locally and how to contribute to the project if it is open source. Markdown is a markup language used mainly for documentation purposes like this `README.md` file.

To view your new file, you can run the `ls` command. Right now, you should only see the `README.md` file listed.

```bash
ls

# Result
README.md
```

### Working with the `git status` Command

To view the current state for your Git repository, you can run the `git status` command.

```bash
git status
```

You should see something similar to this output here:

```bash
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

There are few things going on in this output so let's break it down line by line.

A branch in Git is like a separate workspace or copy of your project where you can try out changes without affecting the main version. The main branch (often called `main` or `master`) is usually the stable version of the project that's deployed to production or shared with users. Other branches are used to develop new features or fixes, which can later be merged into the `main` branch once they're ready.
You will learn more about branches, different strategies and conventions in a later section.

<Aside title="Should you use main or master?">
  Most repositories today will default to the `main` branch. But some older
  repositories will use `master` to represent the "source of truth" and
  production branch.
</Aside>

`No commits yet` means that you haven't saved any changes yet. A commit is a snapshot of your project at a certain point in time. Commits will be covered in more detail later on.

When you add a new file or folder, Git notices it but doesn't track it yet. These are called untracked files, and they won't be included in commits until you explicitly tell Git to track them.

Sometimes you will just want a shortened version of the `git status` output. To accomplish you can run the `git status −−short` or `git status −s` command.

```bash
git status --short

# Result
?? README.md
```

The `??` symbol in the output means that a file is untracked by Git.

### Adding files to the Staging Area

When you make changes to your files, that is known as the working directory. You can use the `git add` command to stage those files like this:

```bash
git add README.md
```

The staging area is a temporary location for those changed files. If you like those changes, then you can commit them which will record that snapshot in your Git repository.
If you don't want to keep those changes, then you can unstage those changes like this:

```bash
git reset
```

To read more about undoing local changes, you can read through this [helpful article](https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/git/undo/#undo-local-changes).

<Aside title="Is using git add . bad?">
    There will be some developers that will tell you to never use the `git add .` command. This command will add all changed files in the current directory (and subdirectories) to the staging area. 
    Most of the time people say this because they have been in situation where they were moving to fast and staged files they didn't mean to.

    But in my opinion, if you are checking the current status of your Git repository using `git status`, then it lower the chances of staging something you didn't mean to.
    Plus, you can always undo changes if needed.

</Aside>

## Committing Your Files

Once you have staged your files, it is time to commit them.

To commit your changes, you can use the `git commit` command like this:

```bash
git commit
```

That will open an editor like Vim, Nano or something else. The editor that opens up will depend on your Git config.

With the editor, you will be able to add longer commit messages with more detail. A commit message is a description of the changes you have made for this commit.

If you just want to leave a short message, then you can use the `-m` flag like this:

```bash
git commit -m "docs: adding readme file"
```

<Aside title="What are conventional commits?">
    Every team and project will have their preferred method for commit messages.
    One common method is to use <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/">conventional commits</a>.

    These are a set of rules on how to write your commit messages. You will prefix your commit message with something like `feat`, `docs`, `chore` or `fix` so your team will know the type of changes made.

</Aside>

## Viewing Your Commits

### Using the `git log` Command

To view all of your commits for your project, you can use the `git log` command like this:

```bash
git log
```

That command will show you each commit starting with the most recent one. Each commit will have a commit hash, date, author and message. A commit hash is a unique identifier for the commit.

To view a more condensed output, you can use the `git log --oneline` command like this:

```bash
git log --oneline

# Example result
418a60b (HEAD -> main) docs: adding readme file
```

If you are interested in learning more about the `git log` command, you can read through this [resource](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History).

### How often Should You Commit Your Changes?

The short answer is it depends. Typically when I am working on a smaller change like a typo fix or small fix in the code, then that will just be one commit.
But if I am working on a larger feature or more involved changes, then I will break up that work into smaller commits.

The reasoning for this is because it will make it easier to go back in the Git history and see when you make certain changes. Also, sometimes you might need to revert back to a commit. So it helps to break up your work.

## Creating branches

As mentioned earlier, a branch is like a separate workspace or copy of your project where you can try out changes without affecting the main version.

### How to View All Branches Locally

So far we have only been working with the `main` branch. You can view all of your branches by using the `git branch` command like this:

```bash
git branch
```

### How to Create a New Branch

To create a new branch, you can use the `git branch` command followed by the name of the new branch you wish to create.

```bash
git branch feature/search-bar
```

Now if you run the `git branch` command, you should see two branches listed.

### How to Switch to a Branch

You are still on the `main` branch. To switch to your new branch, you can use the following command:

```bash
git switch feature/search-bar
```

You should now see the following message:

```bash
Switched to branch 'feature/search-bar'
```

Now you can make changes on that branch that will only show up on that branch and no others. You can use the same commands as earlier to stage and commit your changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add search bar component with basic filtering functionality"
```

### How to Create a Branch and Switch to it in the Same Command

Most developers will choose to create a branch and switch to it at the same time. To do that, you can run the following command `git switch -c <new-branch-name-goes-here>`:

```bash
git switch -c fix-login-error-message
```

### What are the differences between the git checkout and git switch commands?

The `git switch` command is used to switch between branches while the `git checkout` command is used to restore files in addition to switching to branches.

To create a new branch and switch to it using the `git checkout` command, you can use `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`.

To learn more, you can read this <a href="https://kodekloud.com/blog/git-switch-vs-checkout/">helpful article</a>.

## Merging Changes into the Main Branch

In a future section, we will look at how to create pull requests and merge changes from a different branch into the main branch.

But for now, here is how you can merge changes from one branch into the main branch using the terminal.

Let's start by using the same `fix-login-error-message` branch from earlier.

Start by making some changes to the `README.md` file.

Now you when you run `git status` you should see this output in the terminal:

```bash
On branch fix-login-error-message
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md
```

You can stage those changes using `git add .` or `git add README.md`. Then you can commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```bash
git commit -m "docs: updating readme with auth workflow"
```

You can switch back to the `main` branch using the `git switch` command:

```bash
git switch main
```

To merge those changes from the `fix-login-error-message` branch, you can use the `git merge` command:

```bash
git merge fix-login-error-message
```

Now when you open up the `README.md` file, you will see those new changes applied on the `main` branch.

<Aside title="Should you always just merge to main without a review?">
    Short answer, it depends. If you are working on a solo project, especially if it isn't live yet, then pushing to main is fine.

    But once you start working on team projects or solo projects that are live and have users, then you want to go through a review process and ensure that the new changes work and don't break production.

</Aside>

## Deleting Local Branches

When yoa are done with a branch locally, you can delete it by using the `git branch -d` command like this:

```bash
git branch -d fix-login-error-message
```

<Aside title="Make sure not to delete the main branch" type="caution">
    As mentioned earlier, the `main` or `master` branch usually represents your production branch. This is the current state of the project that is live and users are interacting with.

    You want to avoid deleting the `main` branch by accident. If you do delete it, there are ways to recover it using the `git reflog` command.

    Here is a [helpful article](https://rewind.com/blog/how-to-restore-deleted-branch-commit-git-reflog/) on restoring deleted branches.

</Aside>

When you are deleting branches you want to make sure not to delete the branch you are currently on. Otherwise, you will receive this error message:

```bash
error: cannot delete branch 'testing-branch' used by worktree
```

If you are not sure what branch you are on, you can run the `git branch` command which lists all of the locally branches and will show which one you are on.

There will be times where using `git branch -d` doesn't work as expected. Let's say you have a new branch with some changes that you have staged and committed. But those changes haven't been merged into `main`.
If you switch back to the `main` branch and try to delete that new branch, then you will see this error message:

```bash
error: the branch 'testing-branch' is not fully merged
```

If you are no longer interested in those changes, then you can do a force delete like this:

```bash
git branch -D testing-branch
```

## Naming conventions for Branches

There are different naming conventions that teams will use when naming branches.

Some will use the [conventional branch style](https://conventional-branch.github.io/).

For example if you are working on a new feature you might name your branch this:

```bash
feat/add-testimonial-slider
```

Other teams might uses all lowercase names separated by dashes like this:

```bash
feat-add-testimonial-slider
```

At the end of the day, it all depends on what your team decides. I have been on teams that didn't really care about the branching name conventions while other teams were strict about it.

<Aside type="caution" title="Avoid generic branch names">
  It is best not to use overly generic and non descriptive branch names like
  `patch-1` or `fix-code`. You will be in situation where you will bounce
  between different branches and it helps to know at a glance what the branch is
  all about.
</Aside>
