My name is [Jessica Wilkins](https://github.com/jdwilkin4) and I am software developer and educator. I created this resource as a notes site for those going through the workshops provided by freeCodeCamp in their [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/PRyKn3Vbay). When I was first learning about these concepts back in 2020, it was overwhelming to try to remember everything and make sense of it all. This resource is meant to help you on your learning journey and serve as a reference.

Remember, the best way to learn is to practice. Don't be afraid to create your own repositories, make mistakes, and learn from them. And if you need help, reach out to the freeCodeCamp community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PRyKn3Vbay).

Happy coding!
